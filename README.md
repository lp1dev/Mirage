# Mirage
## (Modern Interactive Retro Adventure Game Engine)

Mirage is a retro adventure game engine written in TypeScript/JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to build a quick and easy to use tool to build one's own text game.

It can be used with Node.JS, web applications and mostly anything running with TypeScript/JavaScript.

It requires a JSON game file, containing game configuration and logic. You can have a look at this [example file](./examples/node-cli/game.json)

For more information you can read the [documentation](./doc/).
